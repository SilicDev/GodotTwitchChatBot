## Reporting Bugs

In general keep it at one bug per issue if possible. Additionally avoid posting bugs that have already been reported, searching the issue tracker is not difficult and adding your information to an existing bug report makes it easier for us to find all information on the bug.

Further if you encounter a bug, check the newest commit first. We simply do not have the time to constantly hunt down bugs we fixed in prior versions.

Additionally while Godot supports other platforms than Windows, we currently only have Windows PCs. We might be able to test bugs on Linux but please understand that we may have to ask you to test certain things for us on other systems.

While a minimum reproduction project isn't required, providing one greatly helps us in tracking down the cause.

## Feature Requests

Please keep your requests reasonable to the scope of this project. Apart from that any feature that will find general use is gladly considered for addition.

## Pull Requests

Once we consider the project feature complete (aka 1.0) we will purge the git history and afterwards try to keep the history clean. As such try to work on only one feature per pull request and preferrably keep the PR to a single commit.
